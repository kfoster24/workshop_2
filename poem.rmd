Kill me,   
Jump Me,   
End my life like I care,   
Take this gun and shoot me,   
Don’t look,   
Don’t Stop,   
Just murder me,   
Just end my life tonight,   
As I no longer care,   
Or dare to speak of his name,   
Or cry out his name in vein,   
Murder me,   
Murder me here,   
Just end it now,   
End my suffering,   
Make it go away,   
Just help me from feeling this rage inside of me bursting to get out,   
Please kill me here,   
Take this knife and murder me.
